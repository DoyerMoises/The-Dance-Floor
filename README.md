# The-Dance-Floor

Possibly the most intimidating spot to be at in a party, it’s also the place that provides the best opportunities for whoever has the courage to step on it and show their stuff.

No one has the right to make fun of you even if you’re the worst dancer in the history of the world, because you decided to make yourself vulnerable for a moment or more; you deserve a fair amount of merit from being there at all.

## Why you should step onto the dance floor

The benefits outweigh any embarrassment.

### Showing Off

Now, obviously the dance floor is for dancing: whether it’s with a partner, alone, or in a group, it doesn’t matter. Experience and practice help for this one, but it’s not necessary, in fact, it may even be obsolete because you’ll probably never be able to top the moves of a particular boy at the age of 6 in his tae-kwon-do dojo. The most important thing if you want everyone to be envious of your flow is to never doubt yourself, especially if you’re making things up on the spot. Your viewers might have no idea what steps you’re going through, but if you’re going through them at an unwavering pace, it’ll make them believe that you are an expert at this craft.

If you’re a bit nervous of making a complete fool out of yourself, then here’s some questionable tips from a questionable website that may or may not help you: [3 Ways to Dance at Parties - wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Dance-at-Parties)

### Having Fun

For some people, the simple act of dancing is enough to make them happy, and they don't really care what other people think of them as they move around. These are the purest souls on the dance floor, and almost everyone can learn something from them. After all, parties are meant to be events where you can take a step back from life and enjoy yourself. 

### Finding Someone

You know what I'm talking about. Even though it's easier to access them at more formal gatherings or things like prom, matches are always about, and being open to taking someone's hand and going through steps with each other really opens up the possibilities. Memories will be made whether you like it or not, and in my opinion, dancing will make them fonder. Of course, I'm only talking about making friends with someone, nothing more.

## Endless Possibilities

So, you can probably take a guess that dancing is not limited to these three examples. That means so much more can happen if you just take a step and start bopping. However, you'll have to find that out for yourself, because it's an experience that's different for everbody. No one should be able to tell you all that's possible.
