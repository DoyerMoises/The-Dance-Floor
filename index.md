## The Dance Floor

Possibly the most intimidating spot to be at in a party, it's also the place that provides the best opportunities for whoever has the courage to step on it and show their stuff.

No one has the right to make fun of you even if you're the worst dancer in the history of the world, because you decided to make yourself vulnerable for a moment or more; you deserve a fair amount of merit from being there at all.

### Why you should step onto the dance floor

The benefits outweigh any embarrassment.

#### Showing Off

Now, obviously the dance floor is for dancing: whether it's with a partner, alone, or in a group, it doesn't matter. Experience and practice help for this one, but it's not necessary, in fact, it may even be obsolete because you'll probably never be able to top the moves of a particular boy at the age of 6 in his tae-kwon-do dojo. The most important thing if you want everyone to be envious of your flow is to never doubt yourself, especially if you're making things up on the spot. Your viewers might have no idea what steps you're going through, but if you're going through them at an unwavering pace, it'll make them believe that you are an expert at this craft.

If you're a bit nervous of making a complete fool out of yourself, then here's some questionable tips from a questionable website that may or may not help you: [3 Ways to Dance at Parties - wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Dance-at-Parties/)
